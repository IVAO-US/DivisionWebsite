                        <strong>ðŸ¥³ Nice that you have decided to participate as a virtual air traffic controller.</strong>

                    <p>
                        IVAO â€“ as a technical network, but also as a community for flight enthusiasts â€“ tries to replicate 
                        the real processes and procedures as well as possible under the motto "as real as it gets".<br> 
                        It's lots of fun yet still also requires you to continue your education independently in order 
                        to prepare for the controller exams.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        But you don't need to be afraid, nobody is perfect and nobody was born or joined IVAO as a 
                        professional â€“ apart from the real pilots or controllers who also exist on our network.<br> 
                        Nevertheless, there are some theoretical basics that you should have internalized as a controller 
                        on the network before logging in for the first time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Of course, you also need an IVAO account.<br>
                        If you have not created one yet, this is the first step:

                    <p>
                        FRAs (facility rating assignments) were created for this purpose, which only allow logging in to 
                        such positions based on certain ATC ratings.<br>
                        Generally speaking our division requires at least <strong>AS2 rating (ATC Student 2)</strong> to connect anywhere.<br>
                        Your initial rating as new controller will be AS1 and thus, in order to control, you will need to request ATC training and successfully 
                        complete 10 supervised hours of active controlling as Clearance Delivery/Ground Controller.

                        Once you have decided on an airport, then (unfortunately) you have to start learning again, 
                        because in addition to the uniform basics throughout the US and Canada, every airport is 
                        different and has its own procedures.<br>
                        It is therefore important that you now familiarize yourself with these <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.us.ivao.aero/en/atc/sop" class="font-semibold underline">local procedures</a>
